## Why this repo?
Since the dawn of Mac OS X, later macOS, man has always missed what in the Linux world can be considered as important as air and water: <i>a native package manager</i>. This still hasn't become a reality, but suddenly we had our lord and saviour Max Howell create what is today known as Homebrew. 

Homebrew is a basically a tool that lets you download the stuff that Apple doesn't, everything from git to terminal tetris. And that's not all; using casks even GUI applications can be installed. It truly, <i>truly</i> facilitates everyday life for us developers and paves the way for a joyful experience when installing new software. <b>But there is catch.</b>

<b>The thing is, if you're not as disciplined as [Stephen scheduling his `brew upgrade`'s in his Things list](https://dev.to/stephencweiss/keep-homebrew-formulae-up-to-date-3p7b), things will sooner-than-later get outdated.</b>

Us Gen Z's are the laziest generation out there, and the last thing we and everyone else wants to do is remember to update our packages. <i>"Tommy, don't forget to update your packages before you go visit Nanny!"</i>üíÄ

### Why should I care?
ü™≤ **Bug-free -** Old packages can have bugs that make things break or act weird. Updates usually fix those bugs so stuff works better.

ü•∑ **Hackerman? No thank you. -** Hackers love old software. Updates patch up security holes that bad guys could take advantage of.

üí®**Smooooooth -** Other software on your computer might expect the latest versions to be installed. No update, no fun.

### Thanks to my predecessors, but it wasn't good enough

Tons of ready-made solutions exist (brew-autoupdate which [stopped being official March 2024](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/16822)), but all of them fail to be easy to set up or are way too hard to understand how they work. I wanted to keep it simple.

## Installation
It will take under 1 minute I promise!
### Part 1 of 3: The update script
1.1. Create a directory for the script
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/scripts
```
1.2. Copy the `brew-auto-upgrade.sh` script to the folder, and change the following:
- `TIMESTAMP_FILE` and `LOG_FILE` based on where you created your directory in 1.
- **If you run an Intel Mac**, edit all occurences of `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` to `/opt/homebrew/brew`

1.3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x $HOME/scripts/brew-auto-upgrade.sh
```

### Part 2 of 3: The LaunchAgent file
2.1 Copy the file `com.user.brew-auto-upgrade.plist` to the following location:
```
$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.brew-auto-upgrade.plist
```
2.2 Load the LaunchAgent:
```bash
launchctl load $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.brew-auto-upgrade.plist
```
### Part 3 of 3: Enable notification from Script Editor
3.1 Open the Script Editor app, create a new file and paste in the following dummy content:
```
display notification "pong" with title "ping" sound name "Basso"
```
3.2 Run the script from the top right corner, and then enable Notifications by the Script Editor app
